How to make Khaman Dhokla Recipe :-

Step 1 Prepare the Dhokla batter and let it ferment for 1-2 hours.
To make this easy Khaman Dhokla recipe, take a large mixing bowl and add gram flour, salt, water, lemon juice and baking soda in it. Mix all these ingredients well. Allow the batter to ferment for 1-2 hours. If you are making it in the winter season, this might take longer. In the meantime, pour boiled water in a steamer and grease the utensil with oil.

Step 2 Cook the batter for 15-20 minutes in the idli/dhokla cooker.
Pour the dhokla batter in the greased utensil and cook on low flame for 15-20 minutes. Check with a knife after 15 minutes by inserting it inside the dhokla. If the knife comes out clean, remove it from the stove. Allow the dish to cool and then cut into squares.

Step 3 Prepare the tempering.
For the tempering, heat a pan with oil in it over medium flame. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, add mustard seeds, curry leaves and vertically sliced green chilli. Add 1/2 cup of water in the pan and allow it to boil. On 2-3 boils, lower the flame and squeeze 1/2 lemon, add sugar and green coriander leaves. If you prefer higher spice levels, you can also add some finely chopped green chillies. You can also make Dhokla sandwich by layering Dhokla and adding your favourite sauce to it!

Step 4 Serve the moist Khaman Dhokla with Faafda and Jalebi.
Turn off the heat and pour the tempering on the dhokla and sprinkle the coconut powder over the dish. Transfer the dish to a plate and serve it with any spicy chutney that you like such as green coriander chutney. Khaman Dhokla is best enjoyed when paired with Faafda and Jalebi.

Tips :-
Beat dhokla batter a couple of times to get air into it. This will make the dhokla fluffy. Do this before adding baking soda or fruit salt.
If the batter becomes frothy, do not whisk it more. It should be of thick consistency.
Always use eno while beating the batter. If you don't have eno at home, you can use baking soda and lemon juice in the batter.
The dhokla is always dry, as the chickpea flour contains a lot of protein content , which when mixed with water makes it dry.
Make sure that the steamer is heated for at least 4-5 minutes before placing the plates filled with batter otherwise it may take more time to cook and the dhokla won't be spongy.
